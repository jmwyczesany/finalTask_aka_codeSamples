# Samples

This repository contains final tasks I had done during one of the boot camps.
There are 4 separate projects, each one of them is about one of important things we talk about during the camp.
Please notice that every project has its own README file with more details. 
Projects inside were not meant to be any kind of masterpiece - just a try to show that I am able to write quite clean code
and I know what a unit test is. 

Enjoy :)
